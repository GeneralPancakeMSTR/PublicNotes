# Early Work 
I have been a long time hobbyist 3D modeler, having used Sketchup (extensively), 3DS Max, and Fusion 360.

This is a very small sample of my work produced prior to 2021; even long after "finishing" these pieces I remain proud of them, but I have many other projects produced since about 2008 and now between Sketchup, 3DS Max, and Fusion 360, of varying scale and scope, including some made in professional settings.

# A Year in Blender 
## Starting Out 
I had wanted to learn Blender since becoming aware of it, but had many false starts, usually due to struggling with the interface and lack of informative tutorials. This has changed over the past few years, Blender has steadily updated and improved its UI, and its ever increasing popularity has led to more high-quality educational content being produced for it. So At the beginning of 2021, I gave it another shot. 

I really began with [Arrimus3D's "Goomba,"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYUK5HantuE&list=PLxt9ZAGPLIpcuPkSTGOJ9iZssTG3o1a0p&index=4) a fairly simple poly-modeling exercise. This got me familiar with the fundamental controls and workflow in Blender.

*My first proper model in Blender, a Goomba from Super Mario Bros. Somehow I managed to lose the file for this, so looks like I will need to redo it at some point.*

As a RC Helicopter enthusiast, I was experimenting with modeling the canopy for a [SAB Goblin 380 Buddy](https://goblin-helicopter.com/products/goblin-buddy-380). I attempted this in SolidWorks, which I had picked up a few months earlier, but was struggling so, following the Goomba, decided to try it in Blender. 

This was a relatively difficult exercise in hard-surface modeling, but I really like how it came out.

## The Donut
In search of tutorials, I inevitably stumbled on the famous Blender Guru (Andrew Price) Donut, for [Blender 2.8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPrnSACiTJ4&list=PLjEaoINr3zgEq0u2MzVgAaHEBt--xLB6U&index=2) at the time. Not finding the torus shape particularly interesting topology, and having just finished the helicopter canopy, I applied the process to that, resulting in the following somewhat unique take on the "donut," which I find quite humorous. 

<img src="attachments/portfolio/CanopyDonut.png" width=""/>

*My take on Blender Guru's donut, applied to the RC helicopter canopy model.*

I look at completing the "donut" like forging my first strong link with Blender, putting me into a position where I felt comfortable enough to begin working on new, larger, more personally-directed projects. 

## Experiments in Texturing and Displacement
Going through Blender Guru's donut tutorial, I was introduced to PBR materials and adaptive displacement. I am absolutely amazed by what you can do with such materials, and spent some time just playing with them. The most interesting project this resulted in was using [topographic maps](https://terrain.party/) to displace a plane and pulling satellite imagery for the same region from Google Earth for the diffuse color to create reasonably realistic background landscapes. 

<img src="attachments/portfolio/terrain.png" width=""/>

<img src="attachments/portfolio/terrain_full.png" width=""/>

*Terrain from a simple plane using real-world topographic data as a height map and satellite imagery for  color.*

The principle of displacing a plane with topographic data to create terrain is neither mine nor new, but I expanded the idea by figuring out myself how to get the satellite image for the exact same region from Google Earth, which is not something I had seen before. I wrote a tutorial going over the process that can be [read on my github](https://github.com/GeneralPancakeMSTR/PublicNotes/blob/main/height-map-displacement-with-satellite-imagery.md). 

## Keycaps Redux, SolidWorks, and Python
As an obsessive mechanical keyboard enthusiast, one of my previous projects involved modeling and texturing keycaps for creating custom color themes. Though I had already painstakingly worked on this project in 3DS Max and Fusion 360 (see [Early Work](#early-work)), various issues with those programs led me to redo things from scratch early in 2021 with SolidWorks (to model the keycaps) and Blender (for texturing and rendering them). 

Mechanical Keyboard keycaps come in many varying shapes and sizes, but mostly the similarities are enough between them that, for nearly all the unique shapes I needed, I was able to generate them from the same SolidWorks part, provided different parameters. 

<img src="attachments/portfolio/R1_1u.png" width=""/>
<img src="attachments/portfolio/R4_2u.png" width=""/>

*Two different keycap shapes, "[Row 1](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Keyboard_profile#Cherry) x 1 units" (Top) and "Row 4 x 2 units" (Bottom), generated from the same SolidWorks part file.* 

To get the keycap models into Blender, I exported them from SolidWorks as `.objs` using [this plugin](https://github.com/Aeroanion/Free-Solidworks-OBJ-Exporter). 

To apply the text on the keys, or their *legends*, I exported the models' UV maps (graciously supplied by the exporter plugin) to `.png` files, and aligned the required text over them for each key in Adobe Illustrator

<img src="attachments/portfolio/R2_1u_Q_Ta_UV.jpg" width=""/>

*Legend for the "Q" (with Katakana "Ta," ã‚¿) key overlaid on the "Row 2 x 1 units" keycap model's UV map.*

Then, I imported the aligned legend (excluding the UV map) into Blender as an image texture, where I could use its alpha channel to define the color of the legend and keycap independently. 

<img src="attachments/portfolio/R2_1u_Q_Ta_Shader.png" width=""/>

The problem here is that this process is exactly as tedious as it sounds, especially for around 200 individual keys. Breaking it down to its barest steps, 

- For a given image texture (formatted as Row x Unit x Legend), copy the corresponding base mesh (blank Row x Unit key), and its material. 
- Replace the copy's existing image texture with the current legend image. 
- Repeat for all image textures. 

This is a perfect set of tasks to be programmatically executed, so I wrote a python script (which I do for a living sometimes anyway) to do it. I included a few extra features in the script as well, like automatically loading the blank keycaps/base meshes, and grouping the created keycaps into collections matching the folder structure containing the legend image textures. 

<img src="attachments/portfolio/load_keycaps.gif" width=""/>

*Blender python script that loads all legend image textures in a folder and creates correctly textured keycaps from them.*

There is another problem, though. Keyboards come in a variety of layouts, and manually positioning every keycap for even one layout is an unreasonable amount of work, let alone doing so for multiple. So I wrote another python script for placing the keys. 

This script determines where the keys need to go from a supplied layout (as a `.json` file), that can be produced by the [keyboard layout editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/) website. The idea here being that a user could create their own custom layout, which the python script can use to place the keys accordingly in Blender. 

<img src="attachments/portfolio/keys_move.gif" width=""/>

*Keycaps moved automatically from a semi-arbitrary arrangement into a custom layout using the keycap placement python script (with some keyframing to render the transition smoothly).* 

Notable features of the keycap placement script are 
- Places keys based on a custom layout defined in a `.json` file, which may be generated from the [keyboard layout editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/) website. 
- Supports copying keys if the layout includes duplicates, and will use existing copies if it finds them in the scene. 
- Will hide keycaps from the viewport and render if they are not used in the layout. 

and some equally notable limitations, 
- Though the script recognizes a standard and Katakana-sublegended set of keycaps, it does not support completely arbitrary keys or legends, and cannot generate them if they do not exist. 
- Does not support keycap rotation. 

Note that I revisited and iterated on this project for the purposes of this document. Originally, I had included the ability to easily control the color of the keycaps, but that process needs to be reviewed and probably improved. I would also like to add a UI, support for custom legend art ("novelties"), and perhaps package it into a proper addon and release it to the community, but this is work for the future.

## Sverchok and Phyllotaxis
At some point, I got interested in modelling plants, and in searching for resources came upon [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FELFjIw-0d8) by Erindale Woodford, which demonstrates how to generate a daisy-like flower using a python-based, parametric, plugin for Blender called "[Sverchok](https://github.com/nortikin/sverchok)" by arranging petals and seeds on the contours of [Fermat's spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_spiral) ("[Phyllotaxis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phyllotaxis#:~:text=In%20botany%2C%20phyllotaxis%20or%20phyllotaxy,class%20of%20patterns%20in%20nature.)").

Astonished, I reimplemented Phyllotaxis (based on the principles presented in Erindale's video) with Sverchok, and became immediately addicted. Though instead of applying the process to a flower, I applied it to a Yucca, a plant native to my area. 

<img src="attachments/portfolio/yucca_plant.png" width=""/>

*A yucca plant, probably [*treculeana*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucca_elata) or [*elata*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucca_elata), with leaves arranged in a Phyllotaxis pattern generated using the Sverchok plugin for Blender.* 

## L-Systems 
What my first version of the Yucca plant lacks (as the viewer may have already noticed) is structure. Bigger Yucca plants grow like trees, not something possible to recreate with my model, which originates all of the leaves from a single, central point. 

Sverchok, however, provides the "Generative Art" node, which is essentially an implementation of [Lindenmayer systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system) ("L-Systems") that takes `.xml` "rulesets" in place of context free grammars, and may be used to draw [tree-like structures](https://sverchok.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nodes/generators_extended/generative_art.html#multiple-rule-definition-example). 

Even so, I discovered quickly that writing a ruleset for the generative art node that produced anything even remotely tree-like was not easy, and I struggled with it to basically no avail for at least a couple weeks. 

The breakthrough came while studying [Structure Synth](http://structuresynth.sourceforge.net/), the standalone program off of which Sverchok's Generative Art node is based. Structure Synth takes rulesets in "[EisenScript](http://structuresynth.sourceforge.net/reference.php)" format, which I realized could possibly be translated into the `.xml` format used by the Generative Art node. I tried this idea with a simple EisenScript, and it worked, much to my amazement. 

Searching for more EisenScripts to convert, I discovered [Ankur Pawar's website](https://sites.google.com/site/workofap/structure-synth), which references a [beautiful repository of EisenScripts](https://github.com/ankurpawar/StructureSynth) that I could experiment with. 

I was able to convert Ankur Pawar's "[Fractal Tree](https://github.com/ankurpawar/StructureSynth/blob/master/Tree/fractaltree1.png)" ([EisenScript](https://github.com/ankurpawar/StructureSynth/blob/master/Tree/fractaltree1.es))

which, with a little modification, particularly of the angle and scale values, can be made to produce this 
<img src="attachments/portfolio/fractalTree-like.png" width=""/>
*A modification of Ankur Pawar's "Fractal Tree" to produce a tree-like structure in Sverchok using the Generative Art node.*

With a workable structure, what I wanted to do at this point was instance leaves arranged in the Phyllotaxis pattern on each segment (or branch) of the tree. Due to how Sverchok works, the first step of this meant determining the orientation and position of each segment, then using those properties to create and position corresponding transform matrices.

<img src="attachments/portfolio/tree_matrices.png" width=""/>

*Transform matrices aligned with each branch of a simplified version of the fractal tree structure. These transform matrices may be used to instance objects or further arrangements of matrices at their position and orientation.*

Though a good start, this setup is only capable of instancing the same assembly of objects on each segment, which is not a great approximation of real plants and trees (e.g., which *usually* do not simply have leaves uniformly spread along their branches, although even that sometimes seems [to be the case](https://hort.extension.wisc.edu/articles/euphorbia-myrsinites/)).

There are a few things I thought would make this more realistic 
- The angle ("bloom") of leaves with respect to the segment they are on changes as they move closer to the tips of the plant. This is particularly so with Yuccas, where the leaves transition from pointing downwards near the root of the tree, to nearly straight up at its tips. 
- Leaves may change color the further they are from the plant's root. Again, this is particularly evident on Yuccas. 
- Leaves are not identical, and should have some random variation, both in surface and shape. 
- Leaves may not grow towards the root of the plant.

I was able to achieve each of these features, although not quickly or trivially.

*An early version of my Yucca tree, featuring increasing bloom angle and transitioning color as the leaves get closer to the tips of the plant, and some random variation in leaf shape and material. Textures are procedurally generated.*

Also noteworthy, I switched from hand-modeling the leaves, to using Sverchok to extrude them out of a Bezier curve and applying various random distortions to generate distinct shapes.

This work led to one of my prouder moments of 2021, which was being given the opportunity to go over my process to an audience of 3D enthusiasts, some of them professionals, over a virtual stream. 

A recreation of this [stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eq1qc2pnljk) (I failed to record the original with audio) can be found on my youtube channel, along with a [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJuDzoXgWuA) that covers some further details. I also have written versions of these videos covering roughly the same material, that may be viewed on my Github ([part 1](https://github.com/GeneralPancakeMSTR/PublicNotes/blob/main/lsystems.md) and [part 2](https://github.com/GeneralPancakeMSTR/PublicNotes/blob/main/lsystems_part2.md)).

## Nodevember
[Nodevember](https://nodevember.io/) is a community driven challenge that occurs in the month of November (surprise) to use procedural techniques to complete artwork from a daily (or in the case of 2021, bi-daily) prompt. I took a break from the Yucca to make a few pieces for this year's (2021) event, two of which I am especially pleased with.
